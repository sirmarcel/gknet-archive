## results

This folder collects the raw data used to generate the figures and draw the conclusions in the publication.

`results/` contains the actual data. `tbx/` contains shared infrastructure. The scripts are not expected to be executable, instead they serve as documentation about how data was obtained.

For information on the python environment, see `run/`.
